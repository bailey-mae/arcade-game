## Project Purpose

This game is a project requirement for  the Udacity Front End developer course.
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate competency in object oriented JavaScript.

## How to Load the Game:

Clone the repo and open index.html in a web browser

## How to Play the game

The game loads a 5 x 6 grid. The player character will load at bottom center of the game board. Use the arrow keys to navigate the character from the bottom of the board to the river at the top. The character can move left, right up and down as long as they remain on the board. The object is to avoid the enemy bugs as they cross the board. If the player character collides with an enemy bug they will return to the start position. The river is the character's home. When the river is reached the game is won. Click 'ok' on the alert box to load a new game.
